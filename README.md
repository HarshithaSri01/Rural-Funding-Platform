# Rural-Funding-Platform
The Rural Funding Platform is a web-based solution that connects rural entrepreneurs, farmers, and small businesses with investors, NGOs, and government funding programs. It enables users to list projects, seek financial support through crowdfunding or direct investments, and receive AI-powered grant recommendations.
